# These are some things that i feel are worth Remembering
## When initializing the database,assuming the database instance is db,
## Run db.create_all()
## db.drop_all() will remove all the tables in the database and start afresh

#### Explaining the circular imports in models####

# Anytime python imports something from a module, it still runs that entire module
# when running the application from the command line, we use python app.py
# Python goes in the app and starts importing, when it reaches the model imports, it goes int the
# models module, user in the case, and runs that module,
# in there, it has to import bd from app,which means it has to run app (again) and go through the
# imports again. when it reaches the imports on the models (User since it's the first)
# it recognizes that it was in the user module but didn't see the User model
# Because that model was below the import db,where it stopped to go back to the app module.
# So python will complain that it can't import the User model. This is why it fails on the User
# import and not on the db import
